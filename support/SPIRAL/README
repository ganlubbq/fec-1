To compile the Spiral-generated decoder, simply put the generated code
and header files in the same directory than the infrastructure files and
type "make". 

You can then run the executable by typing "./viterbi". It should
return you the error rates of the spiral decoder and of the generic
C decoder plus the decoding speed.

Note that the speed of the generated decoder files is highly dependent
on the compiler because Spiral produces C code with intrinsics and not
assembly code. Therefore, we recommend using the highest possible
optimization level and switching to the Intel compiler if possible (In
this case, try to use the flags "-fast -fno-alias"). Note that, in
some cases, optimizations may actually make the code incorrect which
is easily detectable because the error rate of the code becomes
unrealistic.
